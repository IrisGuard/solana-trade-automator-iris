      question: "How does the Trading Bot work?",
      answer: "Our bots analyze the transaction flow on the Solana blockchain in real-time, identify opportunities based on AI algorithms, and automatically execute transactions according to the strategies you've selected. Each transaction requires your approval for maximum security."
    },
    security: {
      question: "Are my funds safe?",
      answer: "Absolutely! The bots operate with limited permissions and never have access to your private key. All transactions must be approved by your wallet and you can stop the bot's operation at any time."
    },
    fees: {
      question: "What fees are there?",
      answer: "There are the regular Solana network fees for each transaction. Our platform charges a small percentage (2%) only on profitable trades, ensuring that we earn only when you earn too."
    },
    getStarted: {
      question: "How do I get started?",
      answer: "Connect your Solana wallet, navigate to Bot Control, select a token for trading, set your strategy parameters, and activate your bot. You can monitor its performance in real-time from the dashboard."

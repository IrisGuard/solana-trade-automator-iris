    question: "How does the Trading Bot work?",
    answer: "Our bots analyze the transaction flow on the Solana blockchain in real-time, identify opportunities based on AI algorithms, and automatically execute transactions according to the strategies you've selected. Each transaction requires your approval for maximum security."

  security: {

  },
  fees: {
    question: "What fees are there?",
    answer: "There are the regular Solana network fees for each transaction. Our platform charges a small percentage (2%) only on profitable trades, ensuring that we earn only when you earn too."

  performance: {

  },
  offline: {
    question: "What happens if I lose my connection?",
